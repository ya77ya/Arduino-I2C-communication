Arduino I2C Communication

I2C is an acronym for Inter-Integrated Circuit. I2C is a low-speed serial communication protocol used for transferring data over short distances. If you need to transfer data over a large distance, this protocol is not recommended.

This repository, used two methods which are master & slave communication and transmitter & receiver communication
